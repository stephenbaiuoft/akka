// Working with Device Group (Hierarchy Design for Actor Protocols)
// https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/typed/guide/tutorial_4.html

/**
 * Looking at registration in more detail, we can outline the necessary functionality:

When a DeviceManager receives a request with a group and device id:
If the manager already has an actor for the device group, it forwards the request to it.
Otherwise, it creates a new device group actor and then forwards the request.

The DeviceGroup actor receives the request to register an actor for the given device:
If the group already has an actor for the device it replies with the ActorRef of the existing device actor.
Otherwise, the DeviceGroup actor first creates a device actor and replies with the ActorRef of the newly created device actor.

The sensor will now have the ActorRef of the device actor to send messages directly to it.
